Description: Terminal-emulator State Machine - runtime
 TSM is a state machine for DEC VT100-VT520 compatible terminal
 emulators. It tries to support all common standards while keeping
 compatibility to existing emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, ..
 .
 TSM itself does not provide any rendering nor window management.
 It is a simple plain state machine without any external dependencies.
 It can be used to implement terminal emulators, but also to implement
 other applications that need to interpret terminal escape sequences.
 .
 This library is very similar to libvte of the GNOME project.
 However, libvte is highly bound to GTK+, which makes it unsuitable for
 non-graphics projects that need to parse escape sequences. Instead,
 TSM tries to restrict its API to terminal emulation only. Furthermore,
 TSM does not try to establish a new terminal emulation standard, but
 instead keeps compatibility as close to xterm as possible.
 This is why the TERM variable can be set to xterm-color256 with any
 TSM based terminal emulator.
 .
 This package contains the libtsm runtime library.
